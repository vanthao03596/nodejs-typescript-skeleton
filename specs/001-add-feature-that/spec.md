# Feature Specification: OTP Email Login

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-feature-that`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add feature that allows users to log in using a one-time password (OTP) sent to their email. The login process should work for both new users who are signing in for the first time and existing users returning to their accounts"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to sign in to the application using only my email address and a temporary password sent to my inbox, without needing to remember a permanent password. This should work whether I'm a brand new user or have used the system before.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user with an email address that has never been used in the system, **When** they enter their email and request login, **Then** they receive an OTP code via email and can complete registration/login in one flow
2. **Given** an existing user with a registered email address, **When** they enter their email and request login, **Then** they receive an OTP code via email and can access their existing account
3. **Given** a user who has received an OTP, **When** they enter the correct code within the validity period, **Then** they are successfully authenticated and granted access
4. **Given** a user who has received an OTP, **When** they enter an incorrect code, **Then** they receive an error message and can retry
5. **Given** a user who has received an OTP, **When** the OTP expires before use, **Then** they are prompted to request a new code

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user requests multiple OTPs in quick succession?
- How does system handle email delivery failures?
- What occurs if user's email provider blocks or delays the OTP email?
- How does system respond to excessive failed OTP attempts?
- What happens if user tries to use an already-used OTP?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to initiate login by entering only their email address
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate a unique one-time password for each login attempt
- **FR-003**: System MUST send the OTP to the user's provided email address within 60 seconds
- **FR-004**: System MUST accept the OTP as valid authentication within 10 minutes of generation
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically create a new user account when a first-time email address successfully completes OTP verification
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate existing users to their established accounts when they verify with OTP
- **FR-007**: System MUST invalidate OTP after 5 incorrect attempts
- **FR-008**: System MUST invalidate OTP immediately after successful use
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear feedback when OTP is incorrect, expired, or already used
- **FR-010**: System MUST limit the rate of OTP requests per email address to prevent abuse (maximum 3 requests per 15 minutes)
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain user session after successful OTP verification for 7 days
- **FR-012**: System MUST format OTP as a 6-digit numeric code

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an individual accessing the system, identified by email address, may be new or existing
- **OTP Request**: Represents a login attempt, contains the email address, generated code, creation timestamp, and usage status
- **Session**: Represents an authenticated user's active access period after successful OTP verification

### Dependencies & Assumptions

**Dependencies:**
- **Email Service**: System requires a reliable email delivery service to send OTP codes
- **Email Infrastructure**: Depends on external email servers and internet connectivity for message delivery
- **User Email Access**: Feature depends on users having immediate access to their email inbox

**Assumptions:**
- Users have valid, accessible email addresses they control
- Email delivery is generally reliable with typical delivery times under 60 seconds
- Users can receive automated emails (not blocked by spam filters or organizational policies)
- Users understand the concept of one-time passwords and can follow email instructions
- The system has sufficient capacity to handle concurrent OTP generation and validation requests
- Email addresses serve as unique user identifiers
- Users will check their email within the 10-minute OTP validity window
- Network connectivity is available for both the system and users during the authentication process
